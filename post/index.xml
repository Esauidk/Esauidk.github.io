If we wanted to do multiple transformations on an objects.
$$(M_N * &amp;hellip; * M_1) * P $$
is easier than
$$(M_2 * ((M_1 * P ) + T_1) + T_2)$$
We can calculate the overall matrix onces instead of doing multiple computations for multiple points
Types of transformation $$T(x,y,z) = Translation$$ $$S(x,y,z) = Scaling$$ $$Rx(theta) = \text{Rotation over x-axis}$$ $$Ry(theta) = \text{Rotation over y-axis}$$ $$Rz(theta) = \text{Rotation over z-axis}$$</description></item><item><title>3D Graphics Intro</title><link>/p/3d-graphics-intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/p/3d-graphics-intro/</guid><description>Overview &amp;amp; Affine Transformation 3D Rotation Cos(theta) in the matrix scaling spots Sin(theta) and -Sin(theta) in the matrix sheering spots 2D Rotation $$ \begin{bmatrix} Cos(ϴ) &amp;amp; -Sin(ϴ) \ Sin(ϴ) &amp;amp; Cos(ϴ) \end{bmatrix}$$
3D Rotation $$ \begin{bmatrix} Cos(ϴ) &amp;amp; -Sin(ϴ) &amp;amp; 0 \ Sin(ϴ) &amp;amp; Cos(ϴ) &amp;amp; 0 \ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
Homogeneous Coordinates Have an extra collumn in the transformation matrix to represent translation

Image of Unreal Engine Logo Image from Unreal Engine 5 Teaser Quick Explanation of Unreal Unreal Engine is a 3D creation tool that primarily enables game developers to create 3D envionrments and experiences. In there own definition:
Free to download, Unreal Engine comes with everything you need to build and ship successful multi-platform games and location-based entertainment for any genre. With full access to source code, a robust C++ API, and Blueprint visual scripting at your fingertips, you can develop your title any way you like.</description></item><item><title>DirectX 3D Intro</title><link>/p/directx-3d-intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 18:11:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>/p/directx-3d-intro/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring Direct X 3D and it&amp;rsquo;s implementation as a Graphics Engine! Wanted to share my notes on how to set it up in a quick and simple blog.
There is a bunch of overhead involving creating a window before setuping Direct X 3D, I will not be covering it in this blog, but plan to cover it in another blog.
All the code related to the contents of this blog come from my repository on Github</description></item></channel></rss>
